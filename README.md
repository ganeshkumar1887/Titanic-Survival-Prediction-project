# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-project
The Titanic Survival Prediction project is a classic machine learning problem that aims to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and family size. Using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, the project involves data preprocessing, handling missing value.
